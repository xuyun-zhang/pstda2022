<td><strong>Abstract</strong></td>

<tr>
<td>Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are widely applied to estimate a density function over an unknown data-generating distribution. A variety of GAN models have been proposed to improve the performance of data publication, data management, knowledge discovery, information fusion, etc. Besides benefit, GAN also bring unique challenges to people, among which privacy issues are extremely urgent yet intractable concerns to be extensively investigated. In this talk, we will introduce three novel GAN models in cybersecurity domain, including Seed Free Graph De-anonymization, Privacy Graph Embedding Data Publication and Generative Adversarial Networks for Auto-Driving Vehicles. The results of extensive real-data experiments validate the superiority of our proposed models.</td>

<td><strong>Abstract</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Networked systems have created new opportunities with major societal implications. At the same time, security has emerged as one of the most important socio-technical challenges confronting society. AI/machine learning (ML) techniques are expected to enable networked systems and enhance security. In this talk, I will present my recent research on networked systems and security in the age of AI/ML. First, I will introduce my ML-enabled Counter Unmanned Aircraft System(s) (C-UAS) technology that detects and safely neutralizes rogue drones without destroying them or causing them to crash. This research has been featured by 100+ news media outlets. Next I will present my follow-up research on real-time ML for quickest event (threat/intrusion/vulnerability…) detection. Then I will introduce my research on data-efficient ML, particularly distant domain transfer learning.</td>

<td>How to Ensure Secure Data Sharing with Blockchain in IoT</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Abstract</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>With the rapid development of IoT techniques, IoT networks constantly generate a large amount of data which contain valuable information for various industrial applications after collecting and analyzing. However, it is almost impossible to enable users to effectively contribute their data without privacy guarantees and incentive mechanisms. Such challenges seriously restrict the data sharing in IoT networks. To this end, based on the blockchain platform, we propose a data incentive mechanism to provide data privacy and fairness measures for users in IoT. Moreover, we give two different constructions of the proposed mechanism and analyze their performances on privacy protection and transaction efficiency.</td>

<tr>
<td>Causal learning has attracted a lot of research attention with the advance in explainable artificial intelligence. Causal learning contains causal discovery and causal inference two directions, where causal inference is to estimate the causal effects in treatment guided by causal graph structure and has been extended in tasks of counterfactual analysis, disentanglement learning, and debiasing. In this talk, we will introduce our new proposal of incorporating causal learning into recommender systems, and present two recent research on de-biasing confounding in recommendation and causal disentanglement for Intent Learning in Recommendation. Experimental studies on real world datasets have proven the effectiveness of the proposed models.</td>

<td>Geospatial data is playing an increasingly vital role in today's world. At Geoscape, it is our goal to produce accurate and fresh geospatial datasets that eventually become the foundation for applications such as address verification, noise modelling, emergency service and urban planning. However, the complexity and volume of the source data always make it challenging to produce and deilver those products. This talk gives an overview on how we built a data processing pipeline on cloud to address those challenges. The platform is able to produces accurate, fresh, customer-ready geospatial data products with minimal human interventions.</td>

<td>Every day, security operation teams need to handle a large volume of events, alarms, and escalated data from breached environments. It is very important to have a platform that minimizes the time and effort in handling big data and focuses on the most important aspects for faster incident detection and response. SOAR (Security Orchestration Automation and Response) is an example of such a platform. SOAR requires a lot of research and engineering to develop; however, in this talk, I will shed some light on how you can develop a SOAR and I will share some of my experience in this area.</td>
