# **Workshop Theme and Topics**

<div style="text-align: justify"> The enormous computation, communication and storage capabilities of the state-of-the-art computing paradigms such as cloud computing, Internet of Things (IoTs) and edge computing, have enabled a variety of large-scale applications and services that generate big data. The main and ultimate goal of the collection and storage of the big data is to extract knowledge, intelligence and insights for our decision-makings. Traditional computational intelligence algorithms need to be significantly revised or new computational intelligence algorithms have to be designed in order to make use of the scalable and distributed computing infrastructure mentioned above for big data analytics. However, the characteristics of such infrastructural platforms like ubiquitous access and multi-tenant pose unprecedented security threats on the computational intelligence algorithms and frameworks, render users more vulnerable to privacy leakage and misuse when attempting to extract rich information from big data, and challenge the trust management of the numerous computing services and diverse data sources for computational intelligence. Hence, it is high time to investigate the privacy, security and trust (PST) issues occur in computation intelligence to cater for the era of cloud/edge computing and big data.</div>
